## Abstract  

Audubon Core is a set of vocabularies designed to describe biodiversity-related multimedia resources and collections. Audubon Core was adopted as a TWDG standard in 2014. The Audubon Core Maintenance Group was established to maintain the standard and its documentation. The purpose of this first workshop of the Audubon Core Maintenance Group is twofold: (1) to inform potential users about Audubon Core and how to use it, and (2) to discover areas of weakness in Audubon Core, i.e. desired concepts the standard currently does not address. An important aim of the workshop is to identify the stakeholders and their needs. Participants are welcome to contribute use cases, but the workshop will emphasize group discussion of topics arising during the session. Almost everybody in the TDWG and SPNHC communities has to deal with media at some point, even if it is not their principal area of interest, and we look forward to an interesting discussion.
