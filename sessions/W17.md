## Abstract  

Scientists use a variety of methods to collect, record, and store biological interaction data (predator-prey, parasite-host, pollinator-plant, etc.). Uses for these data are equally diverse. For example, they could play an important role in building decision support systems for conservation and sustainable use in agriculture. Numerous efforts are underway to aggregate, organize, and efficiently disseminate these data. However, we lack a formal data standard to support this work. Following discussions at TDWG16 in Costa Rica, the Biological Interactions Data Interest Group was created in 2017, and organized a symposium at TDWG17 in Ottawa, Canada. This year's workshop will serve to provide an update of the IG activities, advance in the discussions and plan the following year. The session is open to all interested parties.
