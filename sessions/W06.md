## Abstract  

In the last few years, the Living Atlases community, built around the Atlas of Living Australia (ALA) tools, has grown quickly, as evidenced by the attendance of 25 participants from 19 countries on 6 continents to the 2018 International Living Atlases workshop in Madrid, including several institutions and GBIF nodes influenced by the successful workshop at TDWG17. Using the ALA platform for a national data portal is the solution recommended in the GBIF (Global Biodiversity Information Facility) Implementation Plan 2017-2021. In addition, ALA modules work with standards defined by the TDWG community. This year, the Living Atlases community hopes to attract more members in a less technical and more user-focused workshop. During this workshop, we plan to present examples of running modules installed by community members to help participants understand the different possibilities given by these tools.



The one-session workshop will be divided into 4 presentations. On the first one, will focus on the ALA global presentation and an introduction to the community. The three last talks will give an overview of the registry module including collection metadata visualization and data integration using GBIF's Integrated Publishing Toolkit (IPT) and Darwin Core Archives, the occurrence search engine, the spatial portal and different other modules developed by the ALA team. Furthermore, we would like to take some time to discuss use cases showing how institutions could share the burden of some technical challenges or impediments (hosting, technical staff, etc.).
