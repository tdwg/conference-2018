## Abstract  

Collections, aggregators, data re-packagers, publishers, researchers, and external user groups form a complex web of data connections and pipelines. This forms the natural history infrastructure essential for collections use by an ever increasing and diverse external user community. We have made great strides in developing the capabilities of the individual components of this system and we are now well poised to utilize these capabilities to assist in addressing complex research questions. Support of these endeavors needs to continue, but focus should include integration of the functionality provided by the members involved in the pipeline to facilitate the transfer of data between them with as few human interventions as possible. Information, data, and resources need integration in order for the system to function efficiently and to the benefit of all parties, but also facilitate attribution, collections advocacy and sustainability. There are unrealized benefits to collections from inclusion by aggregators and subsequent use by researchers and publishers. The Biodiversity Collections Network (BCoN), a U.S. National Science Foundation funded Research Coordination Network (RCN) is planning a series of symposia and workshops to identify gaps and problems in the data pipeline and explore future steps in coordinating efforts, providing solutions and standardizing tools and methods. The first of these is a needs assessment workshop held in Lawrence, KS in February with a follow up workshop at the iDigBio 2nd Digital Data in Research meeting in Berkeley, CA in June 2018, which will engage a broader community in finding solutions to these issues. The hope is that this symposium, through presentation of progress made so far, will provide context, and allow for further involvement and feedback from the community. Input from both the TDWG and SPNHC communities is vital in solving both the technical and social challenges associated with creating and sustaining these pathways.
