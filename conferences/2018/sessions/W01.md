## Abstract  

Participants in this workshop will get hands-on training in how to audit collection and biodiversity data for duplicate, broken and truncated records; internal data disagreements and missing data; and character encoding issues and incorrect or inconsistent formatting. Auditing will be done on the command line with text-processing tools that are simple, reliable, easy to use and highly efficient for very large datasets. Sample data will be provided by the trainer.
