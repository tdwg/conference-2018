## Abstract  

Natural history collections contain and maintain an increasingly complex array of analog and digital information. Researchers interested in working with collections data must be familiar with the invaluable specimens themselves as well as the images, transcriptions, georeferences, annotations, three-dimensional scans and other digital information that accompanies specimens. Further, researchers must be familiar with analysis techniques that account for the biases, variability, and inconsistencies inherent to collections in order to appropriately address research questions. New skills sets are required for researchers, both early career and established professionals, to access and analyze the complex data sets emerging from the collections community.  

In this round table discussion, we specifically address the data literacy needs of museum staff curating collections data, academic researchers using collections data in various '–ologies', educators using collections data to teach data skills, and undergraduate students preparing for careers in related fields. We aim to build advocacy within the SPNHC and TDWG international communities for the development and incorporation of core data literacy competencies with a basis in collections and collections data. We seek the input and feedback of the biodiversity community to define the skill sets and advocate for biodiversity data literacy skills across all career stages. This workshop is hosted by BLUE: Biodiversity Literacy in Undergraduate Education.
