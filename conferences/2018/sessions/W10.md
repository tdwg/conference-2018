## Abstract  

This workshop has both a broad and narrow goal.  Its broad goal is to introduce participants to the TDWG Citizen Science Interest Group (CSIG), its history and its developing agenda. We will review the CSIG charter and describe some of the challenges, such as standards for common names, and data quality issues that citizen science groups face as part of the efforts to collect and share biodiversity data. We will describe relevant older and ongoing standards development efforts at TDWG, such as name standardization efforts and data quality standards and tool development projects. The narrow goal is to introduce the Public Participation in Scientific Research (PPSR) core and discuss modifications that would help citizen science projects define and communicate aspects of data quality.  Topics for discussion include 1) fields that would allow projects to say if they have a data quality plan and if so to allow projects to provide URLs that point to the plans; 2) define fields that describe the kinds of data that citizens contribute such as collecting a physical sample, annotating a digital specimen, or making a species identification in the field, and 3) linking the data types to specific data quality strategies.
