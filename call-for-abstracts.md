# Call for abstracts

Dear Colleagues,

We are excited to announce the [list of accepted workshops and symposia](/sessions/) for [TDWG2018](http://spnhc-tdwg2018.nz/), which will be held jointly with the Society for the Preservation of Natural History Collections (SPNHC) in Dunedin, NZ, 25 Augustâ€“1 September, and to make the call for individual contributions to be published in *[Biodiversity Information Science and Standards](https://biss.pensoft.net/) (BISS)*.  Instructions for submitting abstracts may be found [here](/instructions-for-authors). **Deadline for TDWG abstract submission has been extended to 26 March 2018 23:59 UTC.** Editors are hoping to notify authors of acceptance by 9 April, or as soon as possible thereafter. Abstracts are required for all oral presentations, computer demonstrations, and posters. These categories are described below.

**Types of Contributions:**

**Symposia or Workshop Presentations**

The backbone of a TDWG meeting are its symposia and workshops. At TDWG, a symposium is typically a collection of talks, sometimes with a panel or open discussion; a workshop may have talks, but typically encourages more active engagement through training activities, or through facilitated discussion around a key issue.  Accepted symposia and workshops are listed [here](/sessions/), along with an indication of whether or not the symposium/workshop is accepting submissions. If you would like to give a talk, you should see if any open workshops/symposia are suitable. Note, some workshops may be held on the 24th or 25th of August because of time constraints.

**Contributed Oral Presentations**

If no workshop or symposium is suitable, you can submit your abstract to the "Contributed Oral Presentation" track. Accepted abstracts will be arranged so that talks on similar subjects are in the same session. 

**Computer demonstrations**

We will provide an opportunity for a limited number of live computer demonstrations. Note that rooms for these presentations may have WiFi connections only (not wired), and you may want to have a backup plan should the Internet connection not work to your satisfaction.

**Posters**

We will provide dedicated space and time for authors to stand by their posters. Posters may be as large as [A0](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_216) in a vertical orientation. Paper or fabric posters will be accepted and the means to afix them to poster boards will be provided at the venue. 

**Wild Ideas**

Towards the end of the conference, we are planning a "Wild Ideas" session of lightning talks. Abstracts will not be required for these.

Best,

Gail Kampmeier<br/>
